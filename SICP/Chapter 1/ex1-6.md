##[1.6](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_thm_1.6)

Alyssa's `new-if` procedure will crash the interpreter.

The special form `if` is not a procedure. As a result, it does not have to abide by the rules of applicative order evaluation. `if` will break the recursion cycle when the guess is made good enough and skip evaluating the alternative `sqrt-iter` call.

Since `new-if` is a procedure, it will always evaluate the consequent `sqrt-iter` procedure, even when the resultant guess is good enough. This is due to the interpreter's use of applicative order evaluation (where operands are always evaluated). This eventually causes the interpreter to run out of memory as `sqrt-iter` calls are being infinitely made.

_`if` is a special symbol because of this exception to the rule of applicative order evaluation. `if` is the tool for recursion (there are definitely more)_

	(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
	    (if (good-enough? guess x) 
	             guess 
	            (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) 
	             x)))
                    
	(define (improve guess x)
	    (average guess (/ x guess)))
	    
	(define (average x y)
	    (/ (+ x y) 2))
	    
	(define (good-enough? guess x)
	    (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
	    
	(define (square x)
	    (* x x))
	
	(define (sqrt x)
	    (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
	
	(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
	    (cond (predicate then-clause)
	          (else else-clause)))
