##[1.9](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_thm_1.9)

The following is a recursive procedure definition which guides a linear recursive process:

	(define (+ a b)
	  (if (= a 0)
	      b
	      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))


The linear recursive process of `(+ a b)` expands as follows according to the rules of the substitution model of evaluation:

	(+ 4 5)
	(inc (+ 3 5))
	(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
	(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
	(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
	(inc (inc (inc 6)))
	(inc (inc 7))
	(inc 8)
	9


This illustrates a linear recursive process because it defers and stores operations until the process can no longer be expanded.

Here's another definition of `(+ a b)` which guides an iterative process:

	(define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0)
          b
          (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

Its expansion:

	(+ 4 5)
	(+ 3 6)
	(+ 2 7)
	(+ 1 8)
	(+ 0 9)
	9

This process is iterative because the formal parameter `a` acts as a counter which preserves the `state` of the process throughout the evaluation.
