##[1.5](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_thm_1.5)

Bitdiddle's Test:

	(define (p) (p))
	
	(define (test x y)
	  (if (= x 0)
	      0
	      y))

	(test 0 (p))

With an applicative order interpretation, Bitdiddle's test would crash the interpreter. The arguments of `(test 0 (p))` are evaluated before the operator is expanded into its representative compound procedures, which in this case would mean the impossible definition `(p)` would be evaluated.

With normal order interpretation, arguments are not evaluated first, and so the interpreter will not encounter the task of evaluating the alternative of `(test 0 (p))`. Normal order interpretation would yield the consequent, 0, for Bitdiddle's test.
